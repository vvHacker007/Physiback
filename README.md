The interest in Fitness and Gym is on the rise, and people have started knowing the importance of fitness and health in these trying times. With Gym costly for many  and lack of proper guidance. Injuries have become very frequent. .<br>
<br>

<br>
There are multiple issues that people face in relation with the exercises, fitness and gym scenario, few of them are given as follows:
- The gym costs a lot of money, time. Many people don't want to pay for a gym membership if they're not going that often.
- Proper feedback and guidance is a must in exercise or else it can lead to painful and sometimes crippling injuries  
- Due to covid, many have opted to do workouts at home. But with , with more than 1000 youtube videos, people find it hard to actually understand the correct technique
<br>

## Proposed Solution<br>
Keeping all of this in mind, we came up with a live workout analysis called Physisback. You can now analyze your past workouts or even your current workout and get feedback all from your home. Physiback uses the power of AI and helps users to get a grade on their exercise and also suggestions all from the comfort of their home<br><br>
